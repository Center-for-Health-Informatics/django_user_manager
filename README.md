# About

This is a Django app that integrates well with the CHI_AUTH tool (though it doesn’t require the CHI_AUTH tool to use). There are a few possible configurations:

- normal Django local login
    - not much benefit over normal Django user system
- local login integration with CHI_AUTH
    - allows users to log in with their UC or CHI credentials
- CHI_AUTH login
    - all login is handled by CHI_AUTH and credentials are passed to this application through nginx as HTTP headers

# Using with django_startup

I already have a django_startup project template that’s already configured to integrate this. That is the easiest way to get started.

See the django_startup documentation, examples, as well as my obisidian “workflow_deploy_django_project” for how to configure everything.

# Using with a new django project from scratch

Download the code from GitHub using pip

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Informatics/django_user_manager.git@v1.1.0#egg=django_user_manager
```

or add to a `requirements.txt` file
```
git+https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Informatics/django_user_manager.git@v1.1.0#egg=django_user_manager
```

Add `user_manager` app to your installed apps

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'user_manager',
]
```

Set the user manager model as your User model
```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "user_manager.User"
```

Select the authentication backends you want to use
```python
# select auth backends to use when authenticating inside the app for development
# the following will first try local authentication, then try CHI Auth authentication
# checking both CHI Accounts and UC AD Accounts. On successful CHI Auth authentication,
# the local user will be created if they don’t exist yet.
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",
    "user_manager.authentication_backends.ChiAuthBackend",
]
```

Define an abstract user
- You need to define an abstract user model on path `project.abstract_user_model.AbstractCustomUser`.
- `user_manager` will use this as the base to create a concrete user model

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class AbstractCustomUser(AbstractUser):
    # add any custom fields or methods you want

    class Meta:       abstract = True
```

Add to urls.py
```python
path('user_manager/', include( ('user_manager.urls', 'user_manager'), namespace='user_manager') ),
```

Customize the behavior of CHI_AUTH
```python
# Which CHI_AUTH systems do you want to use for authentication?
# ucad is UC Active Directory, local is CHI_AUTH credentials for non-UC users
CHI_AUTH_CHECK_SYSTEMS = 'local, ucad'

# if user authenticates through CHI_AUTH but doesn't exist locally, create new user?
CHI_AUTH_AUTOCREATE_LOCAL_USER = True

# new users created locally should automatically generate new user in CHI_AUTH
CHI_AUTH_AUTOCREATE_CHI_AUTH_USER = False
```

Set login/logout paths
- this example is for local login, you could also configure it to use the CHI_AUTH login views
```python
# this url gets called when @login_required view is accessed
LOGIN_URL = '/user_manager/login'

# use as a sign in link <a href="{{ LOGIN_URL_FOR_LINK }}">Sign In</a>
LOGIN_URL_FOR_LINK = '/user_manager/login'

# use as a sign out link <a href="{{ LOGOUT_URL_FOR_LINK }}">Sign Out</a>
LOGOUT_URL_FOR_LINK = '/user_manager/logout'
```
